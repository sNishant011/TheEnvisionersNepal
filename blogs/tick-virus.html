            A disease called Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by a tick-borne virus, has killed seven and infected at least 60, setting off alarm bells among health officials in the country. More than 37 people were diagnosed with SFTS in Jiangsu in the early months of 2020, 23 were later found to be infected in Anhui. While the disease is transferred to humans through tick bites, Chinese virologists have warned that human-to-human transmission of the virus cannot be ruled out. Unlike SARS-CoV-2 however, this is not the first time the SFTS virus has infected people. The recent spate of cases merely marks a re-emergence of the disease. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) belongs to the Bunya virus family and is transmitted to humans through tick bites. The virus was first identified by a team of researchers in China over a decade ago. The first few cases were reported in rural areas of Hubei and Henan provinces in 2009. The current case fatality rate rests between approximately 16 and 30 per cent, according to the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. Due to the rate at which it spreads and its high fatality rate, SFTS has been listed among the top 10 priority diseases blue print by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Virologists believe an Asian tick called Haemaphysalis longicornis is the primary vector, or carrier, of the virus.

Virologists believe an Asian tick called Haemaphysalis longicornis is the primary vector, or carrier, of the virus.


<br><br>According to a study conducted by a team of Chinese researchers in 2011, the incubation period is anywhere between seven and 13 days after the onset of the illness.
<br>
The virus eventually travelled to other East Asian nations, including Japan and South Korea. Since the virus was first discovered, the total number of cases has risen significantly. While in 2013, as many as 36 cases were reported in South Korea, the number rose sharply to 270 by 2017. Meanwhile, China registered 71 cases in 2010 and 2,600 in 2016. The number of infections reported in Japan increased by 50 per cent between 2016 and 2017, a Nature report stated. When the number of cases began to rise in all three countries, public health officials began educating local doctors and ordinary citizens about the health risks posed by tick bites. As more people became aware of the virus and the disease it causes, the fatality rate of the infection began to drop significantly, scientists found.

While a vaccine to treat the disease is yet to be successfully developed, the antiviral drug Ribavirin is known to be effective in treating the illness.

The vaccine development to combat the SFTS virus is not easy due to its characteristics. The virus has very few points to attack because it has only essential DNA and proteins required for just living. Also any treatment by killing the virus is able to give human damage. People say commonly 'to develop an antivirus vaccine becomes useless because there are numerous variants of the virus made.' It says half-right, half-wrong. While it is true that virus mutation happened ceaselessly ever, but a few virus vaccines have been properly produced. Therefore we should do our best to develop the vaccine.

Solution to this paradox is parallel world also called copy world. When a person goes back in time, the person isn't going to his own or original history but goes back in time in alternative or copy world. Any action performed by him/her will only affect future of that parallel universe but not his/her own future.(for now time travel isn't possible to past)
