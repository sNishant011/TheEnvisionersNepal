                            <h1>1.BLOOD RED RIVER (PERU, INDIA:BRAHMAPUTRA, CHINA),PERU:</h1>
                            <p>Cusco’s Red River is formed due to rain run-off from the nearby Palcoyo Rainbow Mountain.
                                The range of colors in this vibrant valley are a result of the different mineral content
                                on different layers of soil, which have been
                                made visible by erosion. The Red River’s coloring is the result of red sandstone full of
                                iron oxide. This mineral-rich sedimentary rock gets washed off the hillsides when it
                                rains and turns the water a distinct red or pink
                                hue (the exact tone depends on the volume of precipitation). Because it is a result of
                                rain run-off, this red or pink river in Cusco is typically only visible during Peru’s
                                rainy season months. During the rest of the year,
                                the river’s water level is much lower and its color is a more typical muddy-brown hue.
                                If you plan to travel to the Peruvian highlands during the rainy season, visiting
                                Palcoyo’s Red River is an excellent option for a unique
                                day trip in Cusco Source:

                            <h1>BLOOD RED RIVER: BHRAHMAPURTRA RIVER, INDIA</h1>
                            <p>
                                Every year, the Brahmaputra River turns blood-red for three days in the month of Ashaad
                                (June). Devotees believe the goddess undergoes her menstrual cycle, and the temple is
                                closed for the three days. On the fourth day, the grand 'Ambubachi Mela' is celebrated,
                                with millions of devotees pouring in to witness the festival. Many say the water and
                                soil are high with iron, which gives it its blood-like hue. Others say a type of
                                red-algae grows in the water during this month. The shrine
                                is located on a hill which has Cinnabar deposits, a red rock known as Kamiya Sindoor.
                                Sindoor is well known for its red colour, and some believe this is the reason for the
                                colour change. Even though there are many explanations
                                as to why the water turns red, no one can explain its duration. It still remains a
                                mystery on why it turns red for only 3 days! Acc to hindu mythology: As the legend goes,
                                Shakti fought with her husband, Lord Shiva, and
                                attended her father's great Yagna without Shiva's approval. It is a custom to pay
                                respect to the mighty Lord Shiva before the start of a Yagna. But Shiva was not invited
                                and Sakthi's father Daksha refused to pay respect
                                to him. Unable to bear the insult, Shakti committed suicide. Furious, Lord Shiva placed
                                Shakthi's body on his shoulders and began his tandav, the dance of destruction. Lord
                                Vishnu, who wanted to stop Lord Shiva from destroying
                                everything, cut Shakthi's body with his chakra. Her 108 body parts that fell are called
                                the Shakti peets and temples are set in these places for the goddess. It is believed
                                that the Kamakhya Temple is set in the place where
                                Shakti's womb and yoni fell. Source:

                            <p>
                                The Racetrack Playa, or The Racetrack, is a scenic dry lake feature with "sailing
                                stones" that inscribe linear "racetrack" imprints. It is located above the northwestern
                                side of Death Valley, in Death Valley National Park, Inyo County, California, U.S.A.
                                Although their tracks across Racetrack Playa – a dry lake bed in Death Valley – have
                                been observed and studied since the early 1900s, no one had ever seen the stones in
                                motion, until the past few years. In August 2014,
                                a group of (very patient) researchers aided by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
                                NASA and others announced they had solved the mystery. Richard D. Norris and his cousin
                                James M. Norris said the motion comes from
                                very thin windowpane ice that sometimes covers the dry lake bed. When the ice begins to
                                melt in late morning sun, it may break up under light winds. Floating ice panels may
                                then push the rocks, causing them to move and
                                leave tracks in the desert floor. The editor- and peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE
                                published their study. Source:

                            <p>
                                The Kerala red rain phenomenon was a blood rain event that occurred in Wynaad
                                (Ambalavayil area) region of Malabar on Monday, the 15th July, 1957 and the colour
                                subsequently turned yellow and also 25 July to 23 September 2001, when heavy downpours
                                of red-coloured rain fell sporadically on the southern Indian state of Kerala, staining
                                clothes pink. Yellow, green and black rain was also reported. Coloured rain was also
                                reported in Kerala in 1896 and several times since, most recently in June 2012, and from
                                15 November 2012 to 27 December 2012 in eastern and north-central provinces of Sri
                                Lanka.
                                Following a light-microscopy examination in 2001, it was initially thought that the
                                rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study
                                commissioned by the Government of India concluded that the rains had been coloured by
                                airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial green alga from the genus
                                Trentepohlia.<br>

                            <p>
                                <strong>History</strong><br>
                                During Cold War between US and Soviet Union in early 1950s, US was conducting low flying
                                recon missions to over Soviet Union but there was fear of being spotted and shutdown.
                                So in 1954, President Eisenhower authorized top secret military base which was very far
                                from human civilization and not easily accessible for spies called Area 51. It is
                                located Nevada desert near a salt flat called Groom Lake. No one knows exactly why it's
                                called Area 51, but one theory suggests it came from its proximity to the Nevada Nuclear
                                Test Sites. The Nevada Test Site was divided into number-designated areas by the Atomic
                                Energy Commission and hence that division was called Area 51. The government never even
                                publicly acknowledged the existence of the base until 2013, with the release of
                                declassified CIA reports.<br>
                                Overview<br>
                                Area 51 refers to a map location and is the popular name for a United States Air Force
                                base. It is at Groom Lake, a dry lake bed in the Nevada Desert, 85 miles (135km) north
                                of Las Vegas.
                                What goes on inside is extremely secret. Members of the public are kept away by warning
                                signs, electronic surveillance and armed guards.
                                It is also illegal to fly over Area 51, although the site is now visible on satellite
                                images. The base has runways up to 12,000ft (2.3 miles/3.7km) long.

                                <strong>What goes on there today?</strong><br>
                                Although official information is sparse, it is believed that the US military continues
                                to use Area 51 to develop cutting-edge aircraft. About 1,500 people are believed to work
                                there, many commuting on charter flights from Las Vegas.
                                Annie Jacobsen, who has written about the history of Area 51, told the BBC that some of
                                the world's most advanced espionage programs are at the site.
                                "Area 51 is a test and training facility. The research began with the U-2 spy plane in
                                the 1950s and has now moved on to drones", she says.<br>
                                <strong>Are there aliens and flying saucers at Area 51?</strong><br>
                                The secrecy surrounding Area 51 has helped fuel many conspiracy theories.
                                Most famous is the claim that the site hosts an alien spacecraft and the bodies of its
                                pilots, after they crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government says there
                                were no aliens and the crashed craft was a weather balloon.
                                Others claim to have seen UFOs above or near the site, while some say they have been
                                abducted by aliens, and even experimented on, before being returned to Earth.
                                And, in 1989, a man named Robert Lazar claimed he had worked on alien technologyinside
                                Area 51. He claimed to have seen medical photographs of aliens and that the government
                                used the facility to examine UFOs.
                                Area 51's association with aliens may have served as a useful distraction for the
                                intelligence agencies.
                                "As early as 1950 the CIA developed a UFO office to deal with the sightings of
                                unidentified flying objects over Nevada. When people first saw the U-2 spy plane flying,
                                no one knew what they were seeing," says Ms. Jacobsen.
                                "The CIA used that disinformation to their benefit by fostering an alien mythology."<br>
                                <strong>What conspiracy theories suggest?</strong><br>
                                According to conspiracy theories, the spacecraft (U.F.O) that was found in Mexico was
                                brought to Nevada and the fuel that spacecraft used unusual and not found in the Earth,
                                it was solid crystal very long lasting or never ending constantly providing energy or
                                creates. Also there were more things done in Area 51 than they claimed. Bob lazar claims
                                that he worked in S4 department of area 51 where there were researches done over alien
                                aircrafts. No civilians, airships, drones are allowed to roam nearby Area 51 and also
                                satellites are not allowed to record its live footage. The images we see on internet are
                                zoomed images from very distant points. According to some conspiracies, before
                                declaration of Area 51 two scientist who were working on aliens got infected and died.
                                Government covered up this case by denying there were no such places as Area 51. When
                                doctor checked their body they found unusual virus not from this planet. Area 51 might
                                be larger than we consider them to be, people claim that there is a huge underground
                                tunnel for secrete operations.

                                atmosphere. It is also called red planet. It is red due to presence of iron oxide in its
                                surface. It is the most widely searched planet for life. Its average distance from earth
                                is 90.2 million kilometers. It's radius is 3389.5 km (about half of the Earth's radius).
                                It's mass is 6.39 × 1023 kg.

                                A magnetosphere is a region of space surrounding an astronomical object in which charged
                                particles are affected by that object's magnetic field. It is created by a star or
                                planet with an active interior dynamo.<br>
                                Solar Wind:
                                The solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of
                                the Sun, called the corona. This plasma mostly consists of electrons, protons and alpha
                                particles with kinetic energy between 0.5 and 10 keV.
                                It is estimated that Mars lost its magnetosphere around 4 billion years ago. A possible
                                reason for this is because of numerous asteroid strikes and the solar wind interacting
                                directly with the Martian ionosphere, lowering the atmospheric density by stripping away
                                atoms from the outer layer. The atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide,
                                1.93% argon and 1.89% nitrogen, along with traces of oxygen and water. It is quite
                                dusty. Recently methane has also been detected in the atmosphere, values of which
                                indicate an active source of gas that should be present be it biological or
                                non-biological.

                                gravity. Due to its less gravity its escape velocity is also low. Due to low escape
                                velocity, it couldn't store light gases and have thin atmosphere. Due to thin atmosphere
                                harmful rays from sun like UV rays easily entered Mars and made its surfae poisonous. In
                                the past temperature of Mars was maintained but due to thin atmosphere it's temperature
                                decreased drastically up to -143° C. Water which were on Mars in the past got frozen due

                                Habitability on Mars.On June 7, 2018, NASA announced that the Curiosity rover had
                                discovered organic compounds in sedimentary rocks dating to three billion years old,
                                indicating that some of the building blocks for life were present. In July 2018,
                                scientists reported the discovery of a sub-glacial lake on Mars, the first known stable
                                body of water on the planet. It sits 1.5 km (0.9 mi) below the surface at the base of

                                the conditions are harsh enough that nothing should be able to survive there, perhaps
                                only beneath the surface.Still, regardless of its habitability now, Mars was definitely
                                once a planet filled with oceans and the right conditions of life. Most people would be
                                happy if we could only find evidence of life that may have existed on the Red Planet.

                                A disease called Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), caused by a
                                tick-borne virus, has killed seven and infected at least 60, setting off alarm bells
                                among health officials in the country. More than 37 people were diagnosed with SFTS in
                                Jiangsu in the early months of 2020, 23 were later found to be infected in Anhui. While
                                the disease is transferred to humans through tick bites, Chinese virologists have warned
                                that human-to-human transmission of the virus cannot be ruled out. Unlike SARS-CoV-2
                                however, this is not the first time the SFTS virus has infected people. The recent spate
                                of cases merely marks a re-emergence of the disease. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia
                                syndrome virus (SFTSV) belongs to the Bunya virus family and is transmitted to humans
                                through tick bites. The virus was first identified by a team of researchers in China
                                over a decade ago. The first few cases were reported in rural areas of Hubei and Henan
                                provinces in 2009. The current case fatality rate rests between approximately 16 and 30
                                per cent, according to the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention.
                                Due to the rate at which it spreads and its high fatality rate, SFTS has been listed
                                among the top 10 priority diseases blue print by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
                                Virologists believe an Asian tick called Haemaphysalis longicornis is the primary
                                vector, or carrier, of the virus.

                            </h1>
                            <p>According to a study conducted by a team of Chinese researchers in 2011, the incubation
                                period is anywhere between seven and 13 days after the onset of the illness.
                                <br><strong>HAVE CASES OF SFTS BEEN RECORDED OUTSIDE CHINA?
                                </strong><br>
                                The virus eventually travelled to other East Asian nations, including Japan and South
                                Korea. Since the virus was first discovered, the total number of cases has risen
                                significantly. While in 2013, as many as 36 cases were reported in South Korea, the
                                number rose sharply to 270 by 2017. Meanwhile, China registered 71 cases in 2010 and
                                2,600 in 2016. The number of infections reported in Japan increased by 50 per cent
                                between 2016 and 2017, a Nature report stated. When the number of cases began to rise in
                                all three countries, public health officials began educating local doctors and ordinary
                                citizens about the health risks posed by tick bites. As more people became aware of the
                                virus and the disease it causes, the fatality rate of the infection began to drop
                                significantly, scientists found.

                                <strong>How is SFTS treated?</strong><br>
                                While a vaccine to treat the disease is yet to be successfully developed, the antiviral
                                drug Ribavirin is known to be effective in treating the illness.
                                <br>
                                <strong>Challenges to vaccine development
                                </strong><br>
                                The vaccine development to combat the SFTS virus is not easy due to its characteristics.
                                The virus has very few points to attack because it has only essential DNA and proteins
                                required for just living. Also any treatment by killing the virus is able to give human
                                damage. People say commonly 'to develop an antivirus vaccine becomes useless because
                                there are numerous variants of the virus made.' It says half-right, half-wrong. While it
                                is true that virus mutation happened ceaselessly ever, but a few virus vaccines have
                                been properly produced. Therefore we should do our best to develop the vaccine.

                            <p>
                                Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in an
                                apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future.
                                It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare
                                the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of
                                quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to
                                as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions. While most people think of
                                time as a constant, physicist Albert Einstein showed that time is an illusion; it is
                                relative — it can vary for different observers depending on your speed through space. To
                                Einstein, time is the "fourth dimension." Space is described as a three-dimensional
                                arena, which provides a traveler with coordinates — such as length, width and height
                                —showing location. Time provides another coordinate — direction — although
                                conventionally, it only moves forward.

                            <p>
                                The laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and that the speed
                                of light in a vacuum was independent of the motion of all observers. Space time Albert
                                Einstein, in his theory of special relativity, determined that the laws of physics are
                                the same for all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed of light
                                within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels. As a
                                result, he found that space and time were interwoven into a single continuum known as
                                space-time. Events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different
                                times for another.

                            </h1>
                            <p>If one goes back in time and kills his grandfather then one's father couldn't be born and
                                without his father , one's existence isn't possible. Then how can one go back in time?
                                This is the major problem of traveling back in time known as Grandfather Paradox.

                                <br><strong>HAVE CASES OF SFTS BEEN RECORDED OUTSIDE CHINA?
                                </strong><br>
                                Solution to this paradox is parallel world also called copy world. When a person goes
                                back in time, the person isn't going to his own or original history but goes back in
                                time in alternative or copy world. Any action performed by him/her will only affect
                                future of that parallel universe but not his/her own future.(for now time travel isn't
                                possible to past)
