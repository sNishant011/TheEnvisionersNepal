                            <h1>1.BLOOD RED RIVER (PERU, INDIA:BRAHMAPUTRA, CHINA),PERU:</h1>
                            <p>Cusco’s Red River is formed due to rain run-off from the nearby Palcoyo Rainbow Mountain.
                                The range of colors in this vibrant valley are a result of the different mineral content
                                on different layers of soil, which have been
                                made visible by erosion. The Red River’s coloring is the result of red sandstone full of
                                iron oxide. This mineral-rich sedimentary rock gets washed off the hillsides when it
                                rains and turns the water a distinct red or pink
                                hue (the exact tone depends on the volume of precipitation). Because it is a result of
                                rain run-off, this red or pink river in Cusco is typically only visible during Peru’s
                                rainy season months. During the rest of the year,
                                the river’s water level is much lower and its color is a more typical muddy-brown hue.
                                If you plan to travel to the Peruvian highlands during the rainy season, visiting
                                Palcoyo’s Red River is an excellent option for a unique
                                day trip in Cusco Source:

                            <h1>BLOOD RED RIVER: BHRAHMAPURTRA RIVER, INDIA</h1>
                            <p>
                                Every year, the Brahmaputra River turns blood-red for three days in the month of Ashaad
                                (June). Devotees believe the goddess undergoes her menstrual cycle, and the temple is
                                closed for the three days. On the fourth day, the grand 'Ambubachi Mela' is celebrated,
                                with millions of devotees pouring in to witness the festival. Many say the water and
                                soil are high with iron, which gives it its blood-like hue. Others say a type of
                                red-algae grows in the water during this month. The shrine
                                is located on a hill which has Cinnabar deposits, a red rock known as Kamiya Sindoor.
                                Sindoor is well known for its red colour, and some believe this is the reason for the
                                colour change. Even though there are many explanations
                                as to why the water turns red, no one can explain its duration. It still remains a
                                mystery on why it turns red for only 3 days! Acc to hindu mythology: As the legend goes,
                                Shakti fought with her husband, Lord Shiva, and
                                attended her father's great Yagna without Shiva's approval. It is a custom to pay
                                respect to the mighty Lord Shiva before the start of a Yagna. But Shiva was not invited
                                and Sakthi's father Daksha refused to pay respect
                                to him. Unable to bear the insult, Shakti committed suicide. Furious, Lord Shiva placed
                                Shakthi's body on his shoulders and began his tandav, the dance of destruction. Lord
                                Vishnu, who wanted to stop Lord Shiva from destroying
                                everything, cut Shakthi's body with his chakra. Her 108 body parts that fell are called
                                the Shakti peets and temples are set in these places for the goddess. It is believed
                                that the Kamakhya Temple is set in the place where
                                Shakti's womb and yoni fell. Source:

                            <p>
                                The Racetrack Playa, or The Racetrack, is a scenic dry lake feature with "sailing
                                stones" that inscribe linear "racetrack" imprints. It is located above the northwestern
                                side of Death Valley, in Death Valley National Park, Inyo County, California, U.S.A.
                                Although their tracks across Racetrack Playa – a dry lake bed in Death Valley – have
                                been observed and studied since the early 1900s, no one had ever seen the stones in
                                motion, until the past few years. In August 2014,
                                a group of (very patient) researchers aided by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
                                NASA and others announced they had solved the mystery. Richard D. Norris and his cousin
                                James M. Norris said the motion comes from
                                very thin windowpane ice that sometimes covers the dry lake bed. When the ice begins to
                                melt in late morning sun, it may break up under light winds. Floating ice panels may
                                then push the rocks, causing them to move and
                                leave tracks in the desert floor. The editor- and peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE
                                published their study. Source:

                            <p>
                                The Kerala red rain phenomenon was a blood rain event that occurred in Wynaad
                                (Ambalavayil area) region of Malabar on Monday, the 15th July, 1957 and the colour
                                subsequently turned yellow and also 25 July to 23 September 2001, when heavy downpours
                                of red-coloured rain fell sporadically on the southern Indian state of Kerala, staining
                                clothes pink. Yellow, green and black rain was also reported. Coloured rain was also
                                reported in Kerala in 1896 and several times since, most recently in June 2012, and from
                                15 November 2012 to 27 December 2012 in eastern and north-central provinces of Sri
                                Lanka.
                                Following a light-microscopy examination in 2001, it was initially thought that the
                                rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst, but a study
                                commissioned by the Government of India concluded that the rains had been coloured by
                                airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial green alga from the genus
                                Trentepohlia.<br>

                            <p>
                                <strong>History</strong><br>
                                During Cold War between US and Soviet Union in early 1950s, US was conducting low flying
                                recon missions to over Soviet Union but there was fear of being spotted and shutdown.
                                So in 1954, President Eisenhower authorized top secret military base which was very far
                                from human civilization and not easily accessible for spies called Area 51. It is
                                located Nevada desert near a salt flat called Groom Lake. No one knows exactly why it's
                                called Area 51, but one theory suggests it came from its proximity to the Nevada Nuclear
                                Test Sites. The Nevada Test Site was divided into number-designated areas by the Atomic
                                Energy Commission and hence that division was called Area 51. The government never even
                                publicly acknowledged the existence of the base until 2013, with the release of
                                declassified CIA reports.<br>
                                Overview<br>
                                Area 51 refers to a map location and is the popular name for a United States Air Force
                                base. It is at Groom Lake, a dry lake bed in the Nevada Desert, 85 miles (135km) north
                                of Las Vegas.
                                What goes on inside is extremely secret. Members of the public are kept away by warning
                                signs, electronic surveillance and armed guards.
                                It is also illegal to fly over Area 51, although the site is now visible on satellite
                                images. The base has runways up to 12,000ft (2.3 miles/3.7km) long.
                                <br>
                                <strong>What goes on there today?</strong><br>
                                Although official information is sparse, it is believed that the US military continues
                                to use Area 51 to develop cutting-edge aircraft. About 1,500 people are believed to work
                                there, many commuting on charter flights from Las Vegas.
                                Annie Jacobsen, who has written about the history of Area 51, told the BBC that some of
                                the world's most advanced espionage programs are at the site.
                                "Area 51 is a test and training facility. The research began with the U-2 spy plane in
                                the 1950s and has now moved on to drones", she says.<br>
                                <strong>Are there aliens and flying saucers at Area 51?</strong><br>
                                The secrecy surrounding Area 51 has helped fuel many conspiracy theories.
                                Most famous is the claim that the site hosts an alien spacecraft and the bodies of its
                                pilots, after they crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The US government says there
                                were no aliens and the crashed craft was a weather balloon.
                                Others claim to have seen UFOs above or near the site, while some say they have been
                                abducted by aliens, and even experimented on, before being returned to Earth.
                                And, in 1989, a man named Robert Lazar claimed he had worked on alien technologyinside
                                Area 51. He claimed to have seen medical photographs of aliens and that the government
                                used the facility to examine UFOs.
                                Area 51's association with aliens may have served as a useful distraction for the
                                intelligence agencies.
                                "As early as 1950 the CIA developed a UFO office to deal with the sightings of
                                unidentified flying objects over Nevada. When people first saw the U-2 spy plane flying,
                                no one knew what they were seeing," says Ms. Jacobsen.
                                "The CIA used that disinformation to their benefit by fostering an alien mythology."<br>
                                <strong>What conspiracy theories suggest?</strong><br>
                                According to conspiracy theories, the spacecraft (U.F.O) that was found in Mexico was
                                brought to Nevada and the fuel that spacecraft used unusual and not found in the Earth,
                                it was solid crystal very long lasting or never ending constantly providing energy or
                                creates. Also there were more things done in Area 51 than they claimed. Bob lazar claims
                                that he worked in S4 department of area 51 where there were researches done over alien
                                aircrafts. No civilians, airships, drones are allowed to roam nearby Area 51 and also
                                satellites are not allowed to record its live footage. The images we see on internet are
                                zoomed images from very distant points. According to some conspiracies, before
                                declaration of Area 51 two scientist who were working on aliens got infected and died.
                                Government covered up this case by denying there were no such places as Area 51. When
                                doctor checked their body they found unusual virus not from this planet. Area 51 might
                                be larger than we consider them to be, people claim that there is a huge underground
                                tunnel for secrete operations.
